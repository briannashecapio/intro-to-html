            <img src="images/paris.jpeg" alt="Picture I took when I went to Paris" width="500">

            <p>I am a second year student here at Algonquin. During my first year at Algonquin I took Design Foundations because I wanted to build my portfolio. A little bit of my personal life, I'm from a small town located in Northern Quebec called Mistissini. It is about a ten hour drive from here but I have lived in Ottawa for approximately 4 years now.
               I have two younger sisters named Gabrielle and Lilybeth. One of them also attends Algonquin and is in the business field.
            </p>

            <p>
                My hobbies include beading, drawing/sketching, cooking, and spending time with my family and friends. The picture above shows a trip I took with my family before the pandemic. We went on a Europe trip to London, Paris, and Rome. 
            </p>
